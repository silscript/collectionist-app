## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: Amazing / Fantastic job here! Your readme and planning docs are
so great, I'd love to use them as a model for other students! The user stories
are solid, the wireframes meaningful, and the documentation thorough.

Based on the status of your project, it's clear that you took it one step at a
time, since you have a solid base of an application that you can keep building on.

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Your app is basic, but meets the requirements for the project. I'd
always love to see something more advanced, but I think this is a good place to
be, especially considering that you lost the weekend / monday to the hackathon.

And again, despite it there not being much new / very complex in this app, I
appreciate how neat and tidy everything is.

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I think your design sense is fantastic, and your use of layout
techniques to produce something visually appealing is awesome. Main reason I'd
list this as `meets` rather than `exceeds` is that I'd like to see something
more creative in terms of what the app can do / how it works (i.e. the
fundamental design as opposed to just visual design.)


## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**2: Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: There are still a few areas for improvement, but I applaud you on
how well organized / structured / named your Ruby / HTML / SASS are. See my
inline comments for some suggestions, but there really weren't many to give.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

** Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Your app has solid documentation and is correctly deployed. The
functionality is basic, but everything that is exposed to the user seems to work
correctly, so great job!
